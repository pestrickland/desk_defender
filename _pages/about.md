## About Project Desk Defender

Desk Defender is a project I started to achieve a couple of goals:

* Design an engaging classroom demonstration of engineering systems
* Develop my design and manufacture skills

I became very interested in promoting STEM subjects early in 2016. Coupled with my knowledge and interest in aircraft weapon systems, what better to to demonstrate a concept than a desktop weapon system?

I set myself an ambitious target:

> Design and manufacture a system that can automatically shoot down a paper aeroplane

Essentially, I imagined having a desktop equivalent to a [Phalanx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_CIWS) or [Goalkeeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_CIWS) close-in weapon system -- designed to protect ships against missile attacks. For the ammunition, I thought that a Nerf-style gun would be best.

## About this site

Over the last few months I've had to focus on various discrete activities for this project, including image processing, 3D printing, requirements development etc. This site aims to capture those activities and keep them in one place, whether in the form of source code, CAD files, photos or just notes.
