You might argue that as a type of Nerf gun, safety needn't be much of a concern. Perhaps, but I have two reasons for putting a lot of effort into safety:

1. As an educational aid, I want to be able to demonstrate this safely in schools
2. As a demonstration of modern systems engineering, an integrated safety system is a good example

## Safety philosophy

## Hazard identification

## Safety design
