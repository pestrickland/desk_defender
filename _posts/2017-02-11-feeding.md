What's the best way to feed balls into a pair of spinning flywheels? A look at machines that launch tennis balls suggests that a gravity feed is sufficient. However, tennis balls are relatively dense. Would gravity be sufficient for foam balls? A look at [Outof darts](https://www.youtube.com/c/outofdarts) again suggests that it could be possible:

That design features a hopper, with a fan assisting the feed towards the firing mechanism. It can be seen that gravity alone is insufficient, with some shaking of the hopper necessary to keep the balls feeding. The positioning of the fan might contribute to that problem, and an improved design can be seen below, which blows air into the hopper, rather than below it:

The use of the fan is common on his designs, as we saw [previously]({{ "/_posts/2016-07-10-balls.md" | absolute_url }}). One difficulty I see with this, though, is whether it is practical for a very large amount of ammunition. Having all the balls constrained in a tube looks OK, but would it be possible to refill whilst the system is running? Ideally, I'd like to combine a hopper feed with the air-driven loading method. Perhaps the hopper could be sealed from the pressurised tubing until the balls are 50% depleted. At that point, the hopper could be opened to refill that half of the tube.
